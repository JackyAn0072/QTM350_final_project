# Introduction

Our final project explores the long-term trends and interrelationships between key development indicators across countries using data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. We focus on life expectancy, fertility rate, population growth, school enrollment, and GDP per capita growth—indicators that collectively reflect the social, demographic, and economic development of nations between 1970 and 2023.

Using these variables, we examine how health, education, and demographic factors evolve over time and interact with one another across countries with different income levels, development statuses, and continental contexts. This includes evaluating how changes in primary school enrollment affect not only fertility and life expectancy but also broader outcomes like economic growth.

## Background

Development indicators are critical tools for understanding how
societies progress over time. Measures such as life expectancy and
fertility rate reveal how access to healthcare, education, and economic
opportunities impact the quality of life and long-term population
dynamics. In contrast, metrics like school enrollment and population
growth highlight the importance of human capital and demographic
pressure in shaping a country’s future trajectory.

Longitudinal data allows us to move beyond snapshots and instead capture
how these dynamics unfold over decades. For example, countries with
declining fertility and increasing school enrollment often exhibit
longer life expectancies, but this relationship may vary depending on
region, income level, or development stage.

The World Development Indicators (WDI) database provides extensive
historical data on these themes, making it an ideal resource for
studying global development trends over time. Our project leverages this
resource to analyze patterns from 1960 through 2023 across over 100
countries.

## Research Questions

Our project addresses the following questions:

1. How has life expectancy evolved globally since 1960, and how is it associated with fertility and education trends?

2. What is the relationship between school enrollment and fertility rate across countries?

3. Do countries with rapid population growth face distinct development challenges in terms of life expectancy and health outcomes?

4. How do demographic and education indicators jointly predict life expectancy, and does this relationship differ by region or development status?

5. What patterns emerge when comparing development indicators between developed and developing nations?

6. Is there a consistent relationship between primary school enrollment growth and GDP growth, particularly when segmented by income group?



## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Analyze long-term trends in life expectancy, fertility, population growth, school enrollment, and GDP growth using the World Development Indicators dataset.

- Examine the interrelationships among key development indicators from multiple comparative angles: by income group, by development status, and by continent.

- Use regression models and correlation analysis to explore how demographic and educational factors contribute to both life expectancy and economic growth.

- Investigate whether countries with extremely high school enrollment rates (e.g., >100% gross) exhibit unique demographic or economic profiles.

- Visualize development trajectories using clear and informative visualizations, including heatmaps, facet scatter plots, and regression overlays.

## Data and Methods

This project uses four key indicators from the WDI:

-   **Life Expectancy at Birth (years)** — `SP.DYN.LE00.IN`\
-   **Fertility Rate (births per woman)** — `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`\
-   **Population Growth (annual %)** — `SP.POP.GROW`\
-   **School Enrollment, Primary (% gross)** — `SE.PRM.ENRR`
-   **GDP per capita (current US$)** - `NY.GDP.PCAP.CD`

## Summary Statistics

Basic descriptive statistics illustrate the wide variation across countries and over time. Life expectancy ranged from less than 50 years to over 85 years, reflecting significant disparities in health outcomes globally. Fertility rates vary dramatically, from under 1.5 births per woman in some developed nations to over 7 births per woman in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Life Expectancy Trends

Globally, life expectancy has shown a steady upward trend. Notably, countries like Rwanda and Ethiopia have experienced gains of over 15 years since 2000, highlighting the success of health interventions.

SQL-based analysis revealed that despite overall improvements, some countries, due to conflict, pandemics, or governance challenges, have witnessed stagnation or declines in life expectancy.

## Fertility Rate Patterns

Fertility rates have generally declined worldwide, aligning with increased educational attainment and urbanization. SQL correlation analysis found a strong negative relationship (-0.68) between fertility rate and life expectancy, confirming demographic transition theory.

## School Enrollment Trends

Primary school enrollment rates have risen significantly, contributing to enhanced life outcomes. However, disparities remain, especially in low-income countries, indicating gaps in access and quality.

## Population Growth and Development Challenges

Countries with high population growth rates, such as Niger and Angola, face challenges in scaling infrastructure, healthcare, and education systems to meet the needs of expanding populations.

SQL analyses show that rapid population growth often correlates with lower life expectancy and lower primary enrollment rates.

## Advanced Insights

### Life Expectancy Growth

Calculating life expectancy growth rates from 2000 to 2023 reveals stark contrasts: while many nations made large strides, others struggled to maintain gains.

### Fertility and Enrollment Relationship

An inverse relationship between school enrollment rates and fertility persists across decades. Higher primary enrollment is associated with reduced fertility rates, reinforcing the critical role of female education.

### Regional Inequalities

Europe and East Asia lead in life expectancy, while Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind, with gaps exceeding 15 years in some cases. Regional averages show persistent inequality despite global improvements.

### Countries Below Global Average

Over 50 countries fall below the 2023 global average life expectancy of 73 years. These countries are predominantly located in Africa and parts of South Asia.

## Data Preparation

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

# Load and clean data
df = pd.read_csv("datasets/wdi_data.csv")
df = df[df["Country Name"].notna()]
year_cols = [col for col in df.columns if "YR" in col]

df_long = df.melt(
    id_vars=["Country Name", "Country Code", "Series Name", "Series Code"],
    value_vars=year_cols,
    var_name="Year", value_name="Value"
)

df_long["Year"] = df_long["Year"].str.extract(r"(\d{4})")
df_long = df_long[df_long["Year"].notna()]
df_long["Year"] = df_long["Year"].astype(int)


df_long = df_long[df_long["Value"].notna() & (df_long["Value"] != "..")]

df_wide = df_long.pivot(
    index=["Country Name", "Country Code", "Year"],
    columns="Series Name",
    values="Value"
).reset_index()

df_wide = df_wide.rename(columns={
    "Life expectancy at birth, total (years)": "LifeExpectancy",
    "Fertility rate, total (births per woman)": "FertilityRate",
    "Population growth (annual %)": "PopGrowth",
    "School enrollment, primary (% gross)": "PrimaryEnrollGross"
})

for col in ["LifeExpectancy", "FertilityRate", "PopGrowth", "PrimaryEnrollGross"]:
    df_wide[col] = pd.to_numeric(df_wide[col], errors="coerce")
```

## Summary Statistics

```{python}
df_wide[["LifeExpectancy", "FertilityRate", "PopGrowth", "PrimaryEnrollGross"]].describe()
```

These summary statistics help us understand the general range and
variability of the four indicators across time and space. Life
expectancy shows a wide range across countries, from below 50 years to
over 80. Fertility rate and population growth also exhibit significant
variance, reflecting different stages of demographic transition.

## Visualization: Life Expectancy Over Time

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
selected = ["United States", "India", "China", "Nigeria"]
for country in selected:
    sns.lineplot(
        data=df_wide[df_wide["Country Name"] == country],
        x="Year", y="LifeExpectancy", label=country
    )
plt.title("Life Expectancy Over Time (1960–2023)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

This chart clearly shows the upward trajectory of life expectancy across
all selected countries, albeit with different starting points and rates
of change.

## Exploring Relationships Between Indicators

We now use a pairplot to explore the relationships among the four
indicators:

```{python}
sns.pairplot(
    df_wide[["LifeExpectancy", "FertilityRate", "PopGrowth", "PrimaryEnrollGross"]].dropna()
)
```

This plot reveals a strong negative correlation between life expectancy
and fertility, and a weak positive association between life expectancy
and school enrollment.

# Regression Analysis

We build a linear regression model to predict life expectancy using
fertility, population growth, and school enrollment:

```{python}
ols_model = smf.ols(
    "LifeExpectancy ~ FertilityRate + PopGrowth + PrimaryEnrollGross",
    data=df_wide
).fit()
ols_model.summary()
```

Interpretation Fertility Rate shows a strong negative association with
life expectancy, suggesting that lower fertility correlates with longer
lives.

School Enrollment has a modest positive effect on life expectancy,
highlighting the role of education in improving population health.

Population Growth shows mixed or negligible influence, depending on
regional factors.

## Additional Insights: Country Group Analysis

We can group countries by income level or region (if data permits) to
further refine our analysis. For now, we use a simple example of
comparing high vs low fertility countries:

```{python}
df_wide["FertilityGroup"] = pd.qcut(
    df_wide["FertilityRate"],
    q=2,
    labels=["Low", "High"]
)

sns.boxplot(data=df_wide, x="FertilityGroup", y="LifeExpectancy")
plt.title("Life Expectancy by Fertility Group")
plt.xlabel("Fertility Rate Group")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy")
plt.show()
```

The boxplot clearly shows that countries with lower fertility tend to
have higher life expectancy.

## Conclusion

Our SQL-driven analysis confirms strong interdependencies among fertility, education, population growth, and life expectancy.

Investments in education, particularly for girls, and access to healthcare emerge as vital strategies for improving national development outcomes. Countries that have successfully managed demographic transitions by lowering fertility and expanding education access have reaped significant health and longevity benefits.

Nonetheless, stark regional disparities remain, requiring continued focus on equitable development strategies globally.

## Future Work

Future extensions could incorporate:

- Economic indicators (GDP per capita, health expenditure)
- Inequality measures (Gini coefficient)
- Health-specific variables (vaccination coverage)

Deeper causal modeling (e.g., instrumental variable regression) could further unpack the relationships identified here.
